# project-3 Proposal 

We are conducting an analysis of three major restaurant chains: McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts, and Subway. Our objective is to evaluate and visualize the risk levels associated with these restaurants based on health and safety violations. For our data collection, we will gather health inspection data and classify restaurants into different risk levels (eg: low, medium, high) based on the frequency and severity of violations. By using Python and Plotly we aim to provide a data-driven perspective on the health and safety performance of the popular restaurant chains.
